# FET | Share
**FET Share** is a database driven website that we are to implement in our University in order
for Engineering Students to share files to one another, Students can also upload
files like source codes and efficient algorithms to solve problems and this codes
will be graded according to the code rank algorithm that will be posted shortly

It is under construction so feel free to contribute ideas and change some stuff. Plus,  
check out collinsgeek.github.io for the index page. More will be added in due time.
 
Remember, the site will not work properly on mobile devices (still writing scripts for   
mobile friendly site )
